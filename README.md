Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed: 
Java Development Kit (JDK) 21+: The application is built and run with JDK 21 or newer.
Apache Maven 3.6+: Used for building and managing project dependencies.
Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
Clone the project from its repository to your local machine: 
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
cd your-project
Use code with caution.

Replace <your-username> and <your-project> with your actual repository information. 
2. Build and run the project
You can run the application directly from the command line using Maven: 
bash
mvn clean spring-boot:run
Use code with caution.

Alternatively, you can build an executable JAR file and run it: 
bash
# Build the project, creating a JAR file in the `target/` directory
mvn clean package

# Run the executable JAR
java -jar target/<your-project-name>-<version>.jar
Use code with caution.

Replace <your-project-name> and <version> with the actual name and version from your pom.xml.
Configuration
The application can be configured by editing the application.properties or application.yml file located in src/main/resources/. 
Example application.properties:
properties
server.port=8080
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
spring.datasource.username=your_username
spring.datasource.password=your_password
Use code with caution.

Usage
Once the application is running, you can access it at http://localhost:8080.
Here are some example API endpoints (if applicable):
GET all users: http://localhost:8080/api/users
POST to create a user: http://localhost:8080/api/users
GET a single user: http://localhost:8080/api/users/{id} 
You can test the endpoints using a tool like curl:
bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/users
Use code with caution.

Technologies Used
Spring Boot: Framework for building the application.
Apache Maven: Dependency management and build automation.
Spring Data JPA: Used for data access and persistence.
MySQL: Example database (you may use another).
JUnit 5: For unit testing.
